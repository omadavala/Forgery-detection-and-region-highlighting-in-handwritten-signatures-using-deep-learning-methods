# Forgery detection and region highlighting in handwritten signatures using deep learning methods
Hi, I have made a project on Signature Forgery Detection using CNN, GhostNet, MesoNet and GoogleNet. Though the domain is generic, I applied the methodologies which are latest and introduced recently to compare the performance metrics of my project with the existing research and how accurate the final result of my project is compared to other.  

I used 2 different datasets from kaggle. There were consisted of more than 4000 files.

Thank You.
