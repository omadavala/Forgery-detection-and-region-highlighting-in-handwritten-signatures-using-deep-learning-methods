# Signature-Forgery-Detection-using-ConvNextTiny-GhostNet.
Hi, I have made a project on Signature Forgery Detection using ConvNextTiny &amp; GhostNet. Though the domain is generic, I applied the methodologies which are latest and introduced recently to compare the performance metrics of my project with the existing research and how accurate the final result of my project is compared to other.  

I used 3 different datasets from kaggle. There were consisted of more than 14000 files.

I got overall accuracy of 89% in ConvNextTiny and 90% in GhostNet.

If you are using the same datasets with different methodologies or different neural network models in Jupyter Notebook. Then my suggestion is to have the RAM size of more than 16 GB.

Thank You.
